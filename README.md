# Machine Learning & Deep Learning from Scratch

This project is a comprehensive implementation of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms from scratch. The goal is to deeply understand the internal workings of these algorithms by implementing them without using high-level libraries (except for basic mathematical operations).

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository contains two main components:

1. **Machine Learning Algorithms** (`/machine_learning/`)
   - Traditional ML algorithms implemented from scratch
   - Includes classification, regression, and clustering methods
   - See [Machine Learning README](machine_learning/README.md) for details

2. **Deep Learning Models** (`/deep_learning/`)
   - Neural networks and deep learning architectures
   - Implemented using only NumPy
   - See [Deep Learning README](deep_learning/README.md) for details

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hachem-boudoukha/machine-learning-deep-learning-from-scratch.git
cd machine-learning-deep-learning-from-scratch
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
